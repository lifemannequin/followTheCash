budgeting groceries and overall expenses.
I wrote this script to help me track where I was spending money and how I could reduce my grocery shopping.It takes in a csv table with data broke it down,type of expenses and if it has one, a subtype of expense. It returns a table of the expenses for each category and subcategory per month.
